# Configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) between GCP and GitLab

This repo contains a sample Terraform module to automate the GCP workload identity creation required for gitlab (can be used for other providers as well).

Terraform code is available under `terraform/` and refer to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` sample gitlab pipeline using this setup.
